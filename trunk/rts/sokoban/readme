NT CONSOLE v0.3
---------------

This is the third release of the NT console support package. As usual
the package does NOT require a Win32 binding and will work with both
GNAT (tested with v3.11p) and ObjectAda (tested with 7.1.2).

ObjectAda users please note that you need to link in the "user32.lib"
and "libc.lib" API libraries (Command line users, make sure the LIB
environment variable points to the APILIB directory and add "-ll
user32.lib -ll libc.lib" to the build command).

The demo program comes from my own current working field this time...

As the version number indicates, further versions are expected, but they
depend on your comments/questions/bug reports.

Note, this version includes the option to en/disable the screen cursor.

The Clear_Screen function now takes non-standard console sizes into
account.

Enjoy!
Jerry.
